# NLP Chatbot using TensorFlow and TFLearn

This project demonstrates how to build an NLP-based chatbot using TensorFlow and TFLearn with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and regression techniques. The chatbot is trained using intents and responses provided in the given JSON format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TFLearn
- Numpy
- NLTK
- JSON
- Sklearn
- Flask (optional for creating a web interface)

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tflearn numpy nltk scikit-learn Flask
```

## Project Structure

```plaintext
- chatbot/
  - data/
    - intents.json  # JSON file containing training data
  - model/
    - chatbot_model.tflearn  # Saved model after training
  - chatbot.py  # Python script for training and predicting
  - app.py  # Optional Flask app for a web-based interface
```

## Training Data

The training data is in the `intents.json` file and contains various patterns (user inputs) and responses (bot replies). Here’s a brief look at the format of the JSON data:

```json
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "tag": "greeting",
            "patterns": [
                "Hi",
                "Hey",
                "How are you",
                "Is anyone there?",
                "Hello",
                "Good day",
                "Whats up",
                "Whats cooking"
            ],
            "responses": [
                "Hello!",
                "Good to see you again!",
                "Hi there, how can I help?",
                "Hello! I'm Dexter. How may I help you?",
                "Hey there!"
            ]
        },
        {
            "tag": "book_table",
            "patterns": [
                "Book a table",
                "Can I book a table?",
                "I want to book a table",
                "Book seat",
                "I want to book a seat",
                "Can I book a seat?"
            ],
            "responses": [""]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Steps to Build the Chatbot

### 1. Preprocess the Data

The first step is to preprocess the input data by tokenizing the patterns and encoding the responses.

```python
import nltk
import json
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Initialize lemmatizer and load training data
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
with open('data/intents.json') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

# Initialize lists
patterns = []
responses = []
tags = []

# Process each intent
for intent in data['intents']:
    for pattern in intent['patterns']:
        word_list = nltk.word_tokenize(pattern)
        patterns.append([lemmatizer.lemmatize(word.lower()) for word in word_list])
    tags.append(intent['tag'])
    responses.append(intent['responses'][0])

# Create a list of words and tags
words = sorted(list(set([lemmatizer.lemmatize(w.lower()) for w in nltk.corpus.words.words()])))
tags = sorted(list(set(tags)))

# Convert the text into a bag of words (BoW) representation
training_sentences = []
training_labels = []

for pattern in patterns:
    bag = []
    for word in words:
        bag.append(1 if word in pattern else 0)
    training_sentences.append(bag)
    training_labels.append(tags.index(intent['tag']))

# Convert labels to one-hot encoding
training_labels = np.array(training_labels)
```

### 2. Build the Neural Network Model

We will use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with TensorFlow and TFLearn.

```python
import tflearn
from tflearn import input_data, fully_connected, regression

# Define the neural network architecture
network = input_data(shape=[None, len(training_sentences[0])])
network = fully_connected(network, 128)
network = fully_connected(network, 64)
network = fully_connected(network, len(tags), activation='softmax')
network = regression(network)

# Create and train the model
model = tflearn.DNN(network)
model.fit(np.array(training_sentences), np.array(training_labels), n_epoch=200, batch_size=8, show_metric=True)

# Save the model for future use
model.save('model/chatbot_model.tflearn')
```

### 3. Predict User Inputs

To predict user inputs, we need to convert the input sentence to a similar format as the training data (bag of words).

```python
def clean_up_sentence(sentence):
    sentence_words = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
    sentence_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w.lower()) for w in sentence_words]
    return sentence_words

def bow(sentence, words):
    sentence_words = clean_up_sentence(sentence)
    bag = [0] * len(words)
    for s in sentence_words:
        for i, w in enumerate(words):
            if w == s:
                bag[i] = 1
    return(np.array(bag))

def respond(sentence):
    p = bow(sentence, words)
    prediction = model.predict([p])
    return tags[np.argmax(prediction)]
```

### 4. Integrating the Model with a Web Interface (Optional)

To integrate the chatbot into a web interface, you can use Flask.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    message = request.json['message']
    response = respond(message)
    return jsonify({'response': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 5. Testing the Model

Test the chatbot by providing a pattern (e.g., “Hi”, “Book a table”) and receiving the bot’s response.

```python
print(respond("Hi"))  # Should output a greeting response
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a basic NLP chatbot using TensorFlow and TFLearn with a Deep Neural Network and regression. You can extend this project by adding more intents, training the model with more data, and integrating it into a real-world application.
